# Setup Issues

### We ran into a lot of problems when setting everything up:
- My computer couldn't install WSL because my computer didn't have virtual machine platform enabled
-     Solution: Go to my BIOS mode and enable it
- My files got corrupted and had to copy them from someone else's computer, but I didn't have enough storage
-     Solution: Delete non-important files and games that were hogging up my storage
- Problem with Gemfile
-     Solution: Downloaded different Gems to help it run
