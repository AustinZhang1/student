# VSCode

### Files
- [_notebooks](/_notebooks/) and [_posts](/_posts/) are where you write blogs
- [_site](/_site/) is where the files that create your site are created, and they are temporary files.
- [README.md](/README.md) is the file that users should read first when looking at your code
- Change the website theme in [_config.yml](/_config.yml)

### Extensions

- The extensions tab has extensions for VSCode that you can install.
- The extensions I have downloaded include Python, Jupyter, and Makefile.

### Terminal

- The terminal can be opened with Ctrl + ` and is where you can run commands.
- The terminal is used to push and pull from Github and to run the Makefile to create your website on a local server.
