## Blog Python Model code and SQLite Database.

### Show your unique collection/table in database, display rows and columns in the table of the SQLite database from VSCode using SQLite3 Editor.

This right here is a picture of my database for my login system. Each row is an individual user, and the columns are for the properties: name, uid, password, date of birth, and pronouns.

### Show your unique code that was created to initialize table and create test data from VSCode model.

These next two images are the code for initializing the table.
This first image is defining the User class, and the different variables associated with each user. Each line defines a new parameter of the user and has properties like if the value can be null or has to be unique.

This next image is a function which defines the valeus that appear in the table. It uses the User class to define each user, along with the parameters for each user.
