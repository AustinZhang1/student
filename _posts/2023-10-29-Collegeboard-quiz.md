## Plans

- As I go through the quiz, note down stuff I didn't know
- Note down problems I missed
  - Research why I missed it and write down
- Note down reminders for my future self

### Notes to self

- The ITEF is an internet organization which developed standards and protocols for internet purposes.
- Iterative/Incremental processes in program development enable programmers to create code with the quickest runtime.
